github actions - continuous intergration service

need to setup a github action
-setup events to listen to (called action)
-once this happens, do something

GitHub starts its own virtual PC, install whichever operating system, install all the npm dependencies and run whichever command that you want it to run

There are thousands of github actions in the 'marketplace'... a series of actions that other people have written.
